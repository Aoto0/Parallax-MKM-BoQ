# Copilot Instructions for Parallax-MKM-BoQ

## Project Overview
This repository is for building a Bill of Quantities (BoQ) system with Material Knowledge Management (MKM). The project uses Parallax for visual effects and focuses on construction/project management workflows.

## Code Quality & Style
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Follow consistent naming conventions throughout the codebase
- Add comments for complex logic or business rules
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose

## Documentation
- Update README.md when adding new features or changing functionality
- Document API endpoints, parameters, and return values
- Include setup and installation instructions for new dependencies
- Add inline comments for complex algorithms or domain-specific logic

## Testing
- Write tests for new features and bug fixes
- Ensure existing tests pass before committing changes
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Test edge cases and error handling

## Commit Messages
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Start with a verb (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update", "Remove")
- Reference issue numbers when applicable
- Keep commits focused on a single change

## Security
- Never commit sensitive data (API keys, passwords, credentials)
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Follow security best practices for the technology stack
- Handle errors gracefully without exposing sensitive information

## Dependencies
- Only add necessary dependencies
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Document the purpose of new dependencies
- Prefer well-maintained and widely-used libraries

## Project-Specific Guidelines
- Focus on construction industry and BoQ domain knowledge
- Ensure material data accuracy and consistency
- Consider scalability for large-scale projects
- Maintain clear separation between BoQ and MKM components
